### Abstract

Reproducible research and science communication are enhanced by literate programming tools like Quarto. Reproducible research ensures that scientific findings can be easily validated, a crucial prerequisite for credible science communication. Leveraging literate programming with Quarto takes this a step further by allowing researchers to create interactive, narrative-driven documents that seamlessly combine code, data, and explanations. Such documents not only enhance the transparency and replicability of research but also facilitate effective science communication by providing a unified platform for conveying complex ideas. Quarto documents can easily be shared in a variety of formats for publishing to journals, presenting talks, and running websites. This provides many options to engage peers and the general public with scientific findings, methods, and implications. 

In this workshop I will lead a discussion into the important research practices of academic writing and branding, introduce the core concepts of literate programming with Quarto, and help you create and publish a Quarto website.

### Structure

* Academic writing tools (word, latex, beamer, rmarkdown, quarto, etc.)
* Reproducibility and communication of science
* Personal branding and online presence (personal website)
* Templates and styles for academic work (journals, slides, monash, etc.)
* Quarto basics (yaml front matter, chunks, output formats, options)
* Quarto content (figures, captions, citations, math, etc.)
* Create and deploy a Quarto website (or slides)

### Pre-requisites

To follow along with the activities in the workshop, you will need a laptop computer with

* A recent version of R (>= 4.1.0)
* A recent version of RStudio (>= 2023.06.0)

To publish your website or slides made with Quarto, you will also need:

* A GitHub account (<https://github.com/login>)
* Authenticate git with GitHub (<https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git#authenticating-with-github-from-git>)

Try to authenticate GitHub before the session, but if you have trouble with this there might be time to help with it on the day.

### Format

2 hour workshop.
